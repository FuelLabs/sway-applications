# Overview

The content in this document is meant to outline the current state of each project within the repository and future work. The reason is that it's easier for a user to glance at a neatly structured document than to browse through the current issues in order to piece together an overview of the applications.

That being said this document is not meant to perfectly track each issue and instead it's meant to be more of a guidance or a vision of where the projects are heading in order to allow a broad overview of each project and enable easier onboarding for contributors. 

For any specific issues we suggest taking a look into the issues and pull requests and using the associated labels to filter by a specific project.

# Applications

The information in this section is split into subsections in order to conceptually differentiate the intention behind the applications. The applications within each subsection are ordered alphabetically for navigation purposes.

<!-- no toc -->
- [Decentralized Apps](#decentralized-apps)
  - The projects in this section are meant to be (complete and) presentable to users in order to show them what the Fuel ecosystem is capable of. This means that the applications in this section require the greatest attention and will likely contain the greatest complexity and the most up to date features.
- [Games](#games)
  - The games section is a mixture of getting started with sway and having complex games function on a blockchain. If you don't know what to build then take a look at any existing games and see if you can improve them, alternatively, come up with a game and code its rules into a smart contract. A user interface or a CLI can be built to allow interaction with your game.
- [Tutorials](#tutorials)
  - The projects in the tutorials are a step down from [decentralized apps](#decentralized-apps) in so far as they are meant to take a new developer through the experience of building on Fuel. It's a place for step-by-step instructions that guide a developer from the creation of their contract to interacting with it via a user interface.
