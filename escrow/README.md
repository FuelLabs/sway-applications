## Overview

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-escrow-smart-contract/

Escrow is the third party which holds the asset(asset can be money, bond, stocks) on the presence of two parties. Escrow will release the fund when certain conditions are met.
For Example, “A” is a seller and wants to sell his car, “B” is a buyer who wants to buy “A”‘s car so they will contact Escrow “C”(an arbiter) which hold the asset until “B” receives the car. When this condition will be met, Escrow will release the fund to “A”. This solves the issue of trust and prevents any discrepancy.
