# Read me

The `README.md` is likely to be the first file that a user sees therefore from the perspective of a user there are certain expectations that need to be met.

## Introduction

A user needs to know what the project is and what it does. The content in this section should be a brief overview of what the project can do and it should not touch on any technical aspects such as the implementation details.

Once a user has an idea of what they are getting into they can move onto the next section.

## Quickstart

The quickstart should inform the user where the project is supported, and has been tested to work, before moving onto the installation and removal instructions.

A user should be able to easily install, use, and potentially remove your project to create a good experience.


## Miscellaneous 

This "section" can be a number of sections which the authors of the project think the user may be interested in.

Some information may include:

- Links to documents such as contributing guides, blogs, socials etc.
- Ways to support the project
- Known issues

There is a variety of content that may be added, however, it's important to note that this is the first document a user will see and thus should not be overloaded with information. If the user can learn a little about the project, use it, and find links to additional content then the document has achieved its purpose.
