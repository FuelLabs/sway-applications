# Style Guide

Programming languages have different ways of styling code i.e. how variables, functions, structures etc. are written. These are not syntactical rules, but rather a set of conventions and best practices to encourage standardization and improve readability. Sway has a style guide which can be found in the [Sway Reference](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/reference/)
