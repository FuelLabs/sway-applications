# Code

Documenting code is an important skill to have because it conveys information to developers about the intention and usage of the project.

In the following sections we'll take a look at three ways of documenting code and a code style guide.

- [ABI Documentation](abi.md)
- [Comments](comments.md)
- [Naming Components](naming-components.md)
- [Style Guide](style.md)

For general documentation refer to how [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html) documents code.
