# Documentation

Documentation is arguably the most important aspect of any open source project because it educates others about how the project works, how to use it, how to contribute etc.

Good documentation enables frictionless interaction with the project which in turn may lead to a greater userbase, including contributors, which causes a positive feedback loop.

In the following sections we will take a look at how to document the:

- [Read me](read-me.md)
  - The first document a user will see which includes content such as installation instructions
- [Code](code.md)
  - Documenting the code itself so that contributors know how to interact with it
- [Specification](specification.md)
  - Presenting technical (or non-technical) information about your project
