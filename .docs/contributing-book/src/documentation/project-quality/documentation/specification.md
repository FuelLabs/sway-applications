# Specification

A specification is a document which outlines the requirements and design of the project. There are many ways to structure a specification and this number only grows when considering the industry and target audience.

For simplicity, a specification can be broken into two levels of detail and the one you choose depends on your target audiance.

## Non-techincal specification

A non-technical specification is aimed at an audience that may not have the expertise in an area to appreciate the technical challenges involved in achieving the goals and thus it can be seen as an overview or summary.

As an example, this may be a developer explaining how a user would interact with the user interface in order to send a coin / token to someone without revealing the functionality behind signing a transaction and why a transaction may take some amount of time to be confirmed.

This type of specification is simple so that any layman can follow the basic concepts of the workflow.

## Technical specification

A technical specification is aimed at users that may be regarded as experts / knowledgeable in the area. This type of specification typically assumes the reader understands the basic concepts and dives into the technical aspects of how something works, step-by-step.
