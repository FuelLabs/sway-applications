# Project Structure

In order to navigate through a project easily, there needs to be a structure that compartmentalizes concepts. This means that code is grouped together based on some concept. 

The following sections will outline the structures of broadly two kinds of projects:

- [Internal project](internal.md)
  - Projects that do not need to expose any interface for external use
- [External project](external.md)
  - Projects that expose an interface that can be imported into other projects
