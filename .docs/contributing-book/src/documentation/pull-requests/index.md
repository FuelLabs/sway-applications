# Pull Requests

A pull request is a term used to identify when a piece of work is ready to be pulled into and merged with another piece of work. This funtionality is especially useful when collaborating with others because it allows a review process to take place.

In order to create a high quality pull request there are a couple areas that need to be considered:

- [Committing your work](commit.md)
  - How to incrementally save your work
- [Creating a pull request](creating-pr.md)
  - How to request a review
