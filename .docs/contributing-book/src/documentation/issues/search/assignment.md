# Checking for available issues

It's important to check if anyone is currently working on an issue before starting to work on it because otherwise multiple people may be doing the same work which is an inefficient use of time.

You can check whether someone is assigned to an issue by looking under the `Assignee` tab and if there is an icon then someone is tasked with that issue. If there is no icon then it's likely that no one is currently working on that issue and you're free to assign yourself to the issue or post a comment so that an author can assign you.
