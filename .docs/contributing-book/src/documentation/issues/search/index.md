# Searching for Issues

There are a few points to consider when looking for a task to contribute to.
The following sections provide a quickstart guide for navigating the issues in the Sway Applications repository.

## [Filtering by label](./filtering.md)

Issues can be grouped into categories through the use of labels and depending on the category a user may choose to contribute to one task or another.

- Is it a bug fix, improvement, documentation etc.
- Is it for the compiler, user interface, tooling etc.
- Is the priority critical and must be resolved immediately or is it a low priority "nice to have"?

## [Checking for available issues](./assignment.md)

Once the issues are filtered a task can be selected if another user is not currently assigned to that task otherwise multiple people may be working on the same issue when only one solution can be chosen.

## [Issue summary](./summary.md)

Each issue should have a description which provides context into the problem and what may be done to resolve it.
