## Overview

The purpose of a timelock is to restrict the execution of a transaction to some window of time. The transaction usually involves a transfer of funds e.g. via an escrow, vesting schedule, deferred payment etc. however, it may also be used for valueless execution i.e. calls to a contract to perform computation.

The transaction arguments are hashed and stored in a queue awaiting a subsequent call for execution. A user may choose to execute the transaction during the window of time or cancel the transaction by removing it from the queue.

More information can be found in the [specification](./project/SPECIFICATION.md).

## Project structure

The project consists of a smart contract.

<!--Only show most important files e.g. script to run, build etc.-->

## Running the project

### User interface

TODO: The user interface does not currently exist therefore its [README.md](ui/README.md) and [SPECIFICATION.md](ui/SPECIFICATION.md) are empty.

### Project

In order to run the subsequent commands change into the following directory `/path/to/timelock/project/<here>`.

#### Program compilation

```bash
forc build --locked
```

#### Running the tests

Before running the tests the programs must be compiled with the command above.

```bash
cargo test --locked
```
