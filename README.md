# Sway Applications

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to contain end-to-end applications that are written in Sway in order to demonstrate what can be built.

This means that generally a project will consist of a Sway contract and a user interface in order to interact with the contract however that is not a hard rule.

> **NOTE:** Sway is a language under heavy development therefore the applications may not be the most ergonomic however over time they should receive updates / improvements in order to demonstrate how Sway can be used in real use cases.

## Project Structure

Each project is independent of the other projects and thus every project has its own directory with all of the files required to make it work.

```
sway-applications/
├── Project-1
|    └── P-1 Directories & files
├── Project-2
|    └── P-2 Directories & files
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

## Contributions

### Issues

If there is a bug, something seems to not work as expected or you have an idea of how something can be improved then make sure to check the existing issues first and if you do not find one related to your issue then raise a new issue and describe your thoughts in detail.

The greater the amount of detail the quicker something can be done to address the issue.

### Adding New Projects

If there is a project that does not exist in the repository and you would like to add it to the list of examples then raise an issue to get some preliminary discussion and fork the repository so that you can work locally.

Make sure to document your code and produce documentation on how to install / run your application.

Before you attempt to create a pull request make sure that you mark it as a draft and that everything works as expected.

Your project should not affect any of the other projects and thus should pass the GitHub CI.
