# Sway TicTacToe

## Rules of the game
1. A 2 Players-game is played on a grid that's 3 cells by 3 cells.
2. One is **X**, and the other is **O**. Players take turns putting their marks in empty cells.
3. The first player to get 3 of his kind in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 cells are full, the game is over. The game ends in a tie if no one has 3 of his kind in a row.
